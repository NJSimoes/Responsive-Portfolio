      <img src="assets/images/headshot.PNG" class="auth-image" alt="Nuno Simoes">

      <p>I was born in Lisbon Portugal.  I have 2 sisters and a brother, all younger than I am.  My family moved to Toronto Canada when I was 10.</p>

      <p>I moved to NE Ohio when I married my wife Kathleen.  I moved to Atlanta 2 years ago to come work for GE.</p>

      <p>The bootcamp has been an overall excellent  experience.  The material is new to me as a network administrator but will be of great use enhancing my skill set in a new area, automating systems as a full stack web developer  The material was presented logically, building on one concept to the next more advanced one.  The instructor was knowledgeable well beyond the scope of the material in the curriculum illustrating examples with a depth of knowledge that satisfied everyone's questions.</p>
